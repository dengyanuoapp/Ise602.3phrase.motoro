<h1> Verilog - Cadence SimVision</h1>

Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL) for developing and
modeling circuits. The Cadence SimVision tool will help you simulate
circuits that have been developed in Verilog.  A useful tutorial to
get started is the following:

<ul>

<li> <a href="verilog_intro-Cygwin.pdf" target="_blank">General tutorial
for using the Cadence SimVision Verilog simulation tool on Lyle
workstations (PDF)</a> (from Dr. M. Thornton, SMU) </li>

</ul>

If you are using the X-Windows emulator on your PC (either VNC or
X11), follow the instructions in the document verilog_intro-Cygwin,
but ignore the initial part about the Cygwin setup. Instead, start up
your X-Windows emulator to get an X-terminal window. At the X-terminal
window, you may create Verilog files and run the Verilog program as
directed in the document.

<h2> Verilog Language Help </h2>

<p>There is an e-book available to SMU students from the SMU library
site: <a href="http://smu.edu/libraries/"
target="_blank">http://smu.edu/libraries/</a>.</p>


<p>Do a "Quick Search" on the "Library Catalog" title "Design through
Verilog HDL". This will get you the e-book by T.R. Padmanabhan, which
is an introductory text on Verilog. Click on the "Linked Resources"
link at the bottom.</p>


<p>Note: if you are connecting to the library site from off-campus,
you will need to enter information from your SMU ID card for
authentication before you will be allowed access to the e-book.</p>

<h2> Developing Verilog Testbenches </h2>

After you have developed your Verilog system modules, you will need to
develop "testbench" modules to test your system modules.  A useful
tutorial for developing Verilog testbenches is the following:

<ul>

<li> <a href="https://s2.smu.edu/~manikas/CAD_Tools/Verilog/Archive2013Jun/lab3_testbench_tutorial.pdf" target="_blank">Verilog
Tutorial: Practical Coding Style for Writing Testbenches (PDF)</a>
(from W. Gibb and T. Farmer, George Washington U.) </li>

</ul>
